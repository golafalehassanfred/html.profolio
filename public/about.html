<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Hassan Fred Golafale, I am  a graduate of the Starz University.<br> My Passion grew for coding when I was a junior student. One of the <br/>One of the courses we did were digital Media which is all  about coding. <br/> </p>
<p> The most regrettable part of is that I stop coding the moment I was  done <br/> With the  Course. Right now, I am  so  glad to be doing  a couse on Undemy  about web development. I  believe that, after I have done with this course, I will have  learn a  lot.</p>
